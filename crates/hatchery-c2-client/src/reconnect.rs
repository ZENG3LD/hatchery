//! Reconnect-with-backoff supervisor for a `gate4agent-c2` control
//! connection.
//!
//! `connect_local` (`runtime.rs`) connects exactly once: if the physical
//! connection dies, every caller holding its `C2ControlHandle`/
//! `C2EventReceiver` is permanently stuck with `C2ControlError::Closed`
//! forever after, with no signal telling them to reconnect. That is fine
//! for a short-lived caller (a CLI command, an E2E test) but wrong for a
//! long-lived daemon that must keep serving requests across a relay
//! restart.
//!
//! This module adds a second, additive entry point,
//! [`connect_local_reconnecting`], that performs the identical first
//! connection `connect_local` does (so a dead endpoint at boot still fails
//! fast, unchanged), then hands the connection to a background supervisor
//! task that keeps it alive: on loss it republishes a `Reconnecting` link
//! state, fails in-flight and new requests fast (`C2ControlError::Closed`,
//! immediately, not after a timeout), and reconnects with an escalating
//! backoff (parking a hard, unfixable-by-retrying failure such as a bad
//! token at a long fixed interval instead of hammering the relay).
//!
//! The returned [`C2ReconnectingHandle`]/[`C2ReconnectingEventReceiver`]/
//! topology `watch::Receiver` are bound to the supervisor, not to any one
//! physical connection: a reconnect is invisible to a caller already
//! holding them -- they never close, and events/topology keep flowing from
//! whichever physical connection is live underneath.
