//! Live, RAM-only fan-out of the node's outbound ACP content stream
//! (`NodeEvent::AgentStream`, the `agent-stream-events-v1` capability) to
//! every operator connection subscribed via `SubscribeAgentStream`. Sibling
//! module to `terminal.rs`, but NOT a mirror of its ring-buffer discipline:
//! `terminal.rs` pairs a ring buffer (`TerminalBufferRegistry`, for
//! `TerminalRead` catch-up and the fresh-subscriber seed) with a coalescing
//! subscriber registry, because every terminal frame is a full,
//! self-contained screen -- nothing here is that uniform, so there is no
//! ring buffer and the subscriber registry below never coalesces: a chunk
//! that does not fit is dropped outright and the loss is reported
//! (`AgentStreamSubscriber::dropped`/`flush_lagged`), never stashed for
//! retry.
//!
//! Seeding, though, is not one rule for all six chunk kinds (see
//! `HarnessOperatorAgentEventV1`'s own doc comment in `gate4agent-harness-api`
//! for the full inventory) -- three different disciplines, not two:
//!
//! - **`Text`, `Thinking`, `Blocked`: instants, never seeded.** A fact about
//!   one moment; a subscriber that was not listening when it happened has no
//!   use for it after the fact, and replaying it stale would mislead.
//! - **`ModeCatalog`, `ConfigOptions`, `ModelCatalog`: current state, always
//!   seeded, latest replaces prior.** The latest one IS the truth about the
//!   session right now, so `AgentStreamSubscriberRegistry` holds exactly one
//!   per kind per session (`AgentStreamSessionState`, recorded by every
//!   `publish` whether or not a subscriber exists yet to see it live) and
//!   hands it to every subscriber that registers for that session, before
//!   any live chunk -- otherwise the one-time announcement at session start
//!   is gone, unobserved, before any subscriber can even name the session
//!   address to ask for it.
//! - **`InteractionPrompt`: state while unresolved, seeded until resolved.**
//!   An open question is exactly as much "current state" as a mode
//!   catalogue for as long as nothing has answered it -- an operator who
//!   connects while the agent is waiting must see that it is waiting, or an
//!   agent can sit stuck behind a gate with no subscriber ever finding out.
//!   The moment it resolves (a `ResolveInteraction` answered it, or
//!   `HostPolicy` decided it on a deadline -- either way something settled
//!   it), it leaves the seed set (`AgentStreamSubscriberRegistry::
//!   resolve_interaction`): the timeline already carries the resolved
//!   history, and seeding a closed question to a fresh operator would
//!   invite an answer to something already decided.
//!
//! "Never seeded" for `Text`/`Thinking`/`Blocked` is still exactly true --
//! neither is ever part of `AgentStreamSessionState`'s replace-latest set --
//! but it used to also mean "gone for good the moment a subscriber missed
//! it", and measured live that gap is real: `SubscribeAgentStream` routinely
//! registers 2-25 s after a session's first turn already started, because a
//! session address exists only after the node has spawned it. Every one of
//! those three kinds published into that gap is now kept in a small, bounded
//! FIFO per session (`AgentStreamReplayRing`, recorded by every `publish`
//! the same unconditional way `record_state` already is), and
//! `AgentStreamSubscriberRegistry::insert` hands a fresh subscriber that
//! ring's held chunks, in publish order, immediately after the state seed
//! above and before anything live -- then exactly one `ReplayBoundary` event
//! per session, so the operator can always tell replayed history from
//! something happening right now. This is deliberately NOT a fourth seeded
//! kind: the ring is read once, at `insert` time, never consulted again for
//! that subscriber, and never restamps a chunk's `published_at_ms` to the
//! moment it happened to be replayed.
//!
//! Kernel-free by construction, like `terminal.rs`: no `HarnessService`/
//! SQLite/`HarnessC2Adapter` dependency, only the plain `RuntimeSessionKey`
//! and wire types.
