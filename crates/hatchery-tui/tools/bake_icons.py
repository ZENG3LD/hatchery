What this does, every run:
  1. For each `MANIFEST` entry, ensure its CODICON source SVG is present
     in `--cache-dir` (default `tools/.codicon-cache/`, gitignored -- a
     scratch mirror of upstream, not a source of truth): download once,
     reuse on every later run. A 404 aborts the ENTIRE run immediately
     with the offending slug and URL named in the error -- never silently
     skipped, never substituted automatically (see ICON LIST substitution
     policy below). Separately, for each `LUCIDE_SLUGS` entry, the same
     fetch-once/reuse/fail-loudly contract against `.lucide-cache/`
     (`fetch_lucide_svg`) -- the two caches never share a slug namespace,
     so neither family's own scratch files can collide with the other's.
  2. Patch the codicon SVG's `fill="currentColor"` (present exactly once,
     on the root `<svg>` element, for every codicon in this set --
     verified against all 57 source files at authoring time) to
     `#cdd6f4`, this crate's own `pty_palette::GATE_FG` -- the same patch
     the original 7-icon rail catalog already applied, so every tier
     reads as part of the existing theme. Separately, patch the Lucide
     SVG's `stroke="currentColor"` to the SAME `#cdd6f4` and its
     `stroke-width="2"` to `LUCIDE_STROKE_WIDTH` (`patch_lucide`) --
     Lucide's ink lives in the stroke, not the fill (`fill="none"`
     throughout, untouched), which is the entire reason this family is
     worth baking alongside codicons at all: one number governs every
     glyph's line weight, unlike codicons' per-path fixed geometry.
  3. Rasterize every sixel tier (rail/compact/strip/gallery) via `resvg`
     (SVG -> PNG) + `ffmpeg` (PNG -> padded -> raw RGBA8) -- see
     `rasterize_sixel`/`rasterize_compact_sixel`/`rasterize_strip_sixel`/
     `rasterize_gallery_sixel` below for the exact filter graphs,
     reproduced in each function's own doc comment so a human can re-run
     the equivalent `resvg`/`ffmpeg` CLI invocations by hand without
     reading Python. This tool writes ONLY that raw, TRUE-coverage buffer
     to disk (`<stem>.rgba`/`<stem>_strip.rgba`/`<stem>_gallery.rgba`/
     `<stem>_compact.rgba`) -- it no longer derives any background-
     composited variant at all (see cause 1 below for why baking a fixed
     background here was itself the defect this tool used to ship: the
     button's own real background is a RUNTIME fact -- either a live OSC
     11 terminal query or the app's own override theme, decided per RUN,
     never knowable at bake time -- so compositing now happens in Rust,
     on demand, against whichever background is actually in play; see
     `../src/icons.rs::composite_over_background`). SKIPPED (idempotent,
     no network/subprocess work at all) for any icon whose raw outputs
     already exist on disk at the expected byte length, unless `--force`.
     Lucide reuses these EXACT SAME rasterize functions unchanged (see
     `ensure_lucide_assets` and friends, right below the codicon `ensure_
     *` functions) -- the lattice-fit machinery cause 6 below describes is
     family-agnostic, only the fetch/patch step (step 1/2 above) differs.
  4. Regenerate `src/icons/catalog.rs` from the FULL manifest (only when
     not restricted by `--only`) -- one `IconId` enum variant (shared by
     both families), one raw-bytes lookup per tier/family (the compact
     tier ALSO keeps its own pre-encoded `LazyLock<String>`, see cause 1
     below for why compact is the one tier that stays exactly as it was),
     one Lucide `Option`-wrapped raw-bytes lookup per tier (`None` for the
     two `LUCIDE_GAPS` icons), one ascii literal, one `lucide_slug`
     mapping entry, per icon.
  5. Bake `LUCIDE_SLUGS`' own assets (skipping `LUCIDE_GAPS` entirely --
     no file, no catalog entry, a real gap, not an invented substitute).
  6. Print a report: the full `IconId` -> Lucide slug mapping, the
     reported gaps and why, and asset-size totals for both families.

Nothing here is a build-time Cargo dependency -- `resvg`/`ffmpeg` run
once, offline, from a developer's own PATH, producing checked-in
`.rgba` files `include_bytes!`'d at compile time (see `src/icons.rs`).

## Quality pass (dirty edges / blurred strokes / gamma-space compositing /
## cell-height mismatch / control-strip resize / strip-tier glyph clutter)

Seven defects diagnosed against the running TUI, each verified against
this tool's own pipeline (not taken on faith) before fixing. Cause 4
below was RETIRED once cause 1's own fix was widened to cover every
`PtyColorMode`, not just `GateOverride` -- its own entry stays in place,
marked retired, so the numbering below still lines up with `icons.rs`'s
own doc comments and this crate's own git history.

1. DIRTY EDGES -- CONFIRMED, root cause identified precisely. Every sixel
   asset was baked with a transparent background and encoded via
   `icy_sixel::BackgroundMode::Transparent`. `icy_sixel` 0.6's own encoder
   (`encoder.rs::sixel_encode_impl`) applies a HARD alpha>=128 opacity
   threshold per pixel -- there is no partial-coverage/blend information
   in the encoded SIXEL stream at all, only "fully drawn, at this pixel's
   flat ink colour" or "fully undrawn". Windows Terminal's own sixel
   decoder does not implement the "undrawn -> show whatever is already
   there" transparency semantics DEC's P2=1 mode specifies, so "undrawn"
   pixels do not read as transparent in practice, and even where a
   partial-coverage pixel DOES survive the threshold, the only RGB this
   encoder ever sees for it is the flat, un-blended ink colour (see
   `../icons.rs`'s own module doc on straight alpha) -- so anti-aliasing
   cannot survive this encoder in alpha at all, only in RGB. FIX: composite
   EVERY sixel-tier icon (rail/strip/gallery -- compact is out of scope,
   see `ensure_compact_assets`'s own doc comment) over the EXACT
   background colour the button actually shows there, fully opaque, so
   the encoder's threshold and the terminal's transparency support both
   become irrelevant -- there is no transparent pixel left to mishandle,
   and the anti-aliasing this buys back rides in the RGB channels
   instead, where the encoder's own hard threshold cannot touch it.

   FIRST ITERATION (retired) -- baked a FIXED composite per background at
   THIS tool's own bake time (`composite_over_background`, a pure-Python
   pass over an already-rasterized buffer -- never a second resvg/ffmpeg
   call, so it could never regress into cause 2's own double-resampling
   anti-pattern), against two hand-picked constants
   (`GATE_ACTIVE_BG_RGB`/`GATE_ACCENT_BG_RGB`, hand-synced to `render.rs`'s
   own `ACTIVE_BG`/`MAUVE`) written into every icon-bearing button's own
   cell background UNCONDITIONALLY, in every `PtyColorMode` (see cause 4
   below, retired). That traded the dirty-edge defect for a NEW one: in
   `PtyColorMode::Inherited` the terminal's own real background is neither
   of those two constants (measured on the owner's own Windows Terminal:
   (12,12,12), nowhere close to `ACTIVE_BG`'s (30,30,46)), so every icon-
   bearing surface now painted a visibly LIGHTER, "standing out" plate
   against the actually-darker terminal around it -- the button's own
   stated background was simply wrong, not merely un-painted. The
   underlying premise ("the background is unknowable at bake time, so
   fix ONE and paint it everywhere") was itself the mistake: a terminal's
   real background is not a build-time fact at all, it is whatever THAT
   terminal reports at THAT run, over OSC 11 (`ESC ] 11 ; ? BEL`) --
   knowable at RUNTIME, never at bake time, and never a single constant
   across every environment this binary ships to.

   CURRENT FIX -- compositing moved OUT of this tool entirely and into
   Rust, at RUNTIME (`../src/icons.rs::composite_over_background`, the
   exact same linear-light arithmetic cause 3 below established, ported
   byte-for-byte rather than re-derived): the client queries the real
   terminal background once at startup (`client.rs`, before the alternate
   screen takes over stdin) and composites each icon on demand against
   whichever concrete background is actually live for that placement --
   the queried terminal colour (or a documented dark fallback if the
   terminal never answers) for an UN-selected button in `PtyColorMode::
   Inherited`, the app's own fixed `GateOverride` theme colour for that
   same mode, and the fixed selected-state accent (`render.rs`'s own
   `MAUVE`) wherever a button is genuinely selected -- cached by (icon,
   tier, family, background RGB) so the encode itself still only happens
   once per distinct combination actually seen, never per frame. This
   tool's OWN job shrank accordingly: it rasterizes and ships ONLY the
   raw, TRUE-coverage source buffer per icon/tier/family (`ensure_assets`/
   `ensure_strip_assets`/`ensure_gallery_assets` and their Lucide
   equivalents below) -- there is no more `_gate`/`_gate_active`/
   `_gate_accent` variant baked here at all, and no more `GATE_ACTIVE_BG_
   RGB`/`GATE_ACCENT_BG_RGB`/`composite_over_background` in this file.

2. BLURRED STROKES -- diagnosed as "rasterized on a non-integer scale from
   a 24-unit source grid"; PARTIALLY CONFIRMED, PARTIALLY REFUTED once
   checked against the actual 57-icon manifest and the actual pipeline:
   - The "24-unit grid" premise is WRONG for most of this set: 52/57
     source SVGs use a 16x16 viewBox, only 4 use 24x24 (`files`,
     `settings-gear`, `source-control`, `terminal`) and 1 uses 24x25
     (`output`, already a documented exception elsewhere in this file).
   - The "second ffmpeg downscale" claim is REFUTED for every SIXEL tier:
     each rasterize function does exactly ONE resvg pass, directly at (or
     fit within) the target pixel size, followed only by a SAME-SIZE
     ffmpeg pad.
   - The underlying mechanism IS real, though: rasterizing a straight,
     axis-aligned 1-source-unit stroke at a size that is not an integer
     multiple of its own source grid measurably softens it. The strip/
     gallery tiers (~20x19/60x57px, forced by their own required cell
     footprint, not an integer multiple of either 16 or 24) use a single
     resvg AA pass DIRECTLY at that target size -- the third option this
     task's own original brief named ("the target size with resvg's own
     high-quality AA applied ONCE"), and the only one available without
     either breaking the required button footprint or reintroducing a
     second resampling pass. The rail/compact tiers keep their own
     analogous single-pass treatment (see cause 5 below for their own
     pixel-size fix, orthogonal to this one).

3. GAMMA-SPACE COMPOSITING (anti-aliased edges read grainy/washed-out,
   worst at the smallest tier) -- CONFIRMED. A naive compositor blends the
   straight 8-bit sRGB channel bytes directly (`out = ink*(a/255) +
   bg*(1-a/255)`), which is wrong: sRGB is a non-linear encoding of
   light, so a coverage weight (what `a` actually is here -- resvg's own
   straight-alpha convention, see `../icons.rs`'s own module doc) must be
   blended in LINEAR light, not in the gamma-encoded byte domain. Against
   this crate's own ink `#cdd6f4` (204,214,242) on a near-black terminal
   background (12,12,12) the error is large and systematic (R channel):
   25% coverage -> naive 60, correct 109; 50% -> naive 108, correct 150;
   75% -> naive 156, correct 180 -- every anti-aliased edge pixel lands
   24-49 levels too dark. A codicon stroke is ~1.5 units in a 24-unit
   viewBox -- at the strip tier's own ~19px height that is barely more
   than one device pixel, i.e. ALMOST ENTIRELY edge pixels, which is
   exactly why the small tier reads as grainy and washed out while the
   rail tier (a wider stroke in device pixels, surviving core ink pixels)
   reads acceptable. FIX: convert both the ink and the background from
   sRGB to linear (`srgb_to_linear`, the exact piecewise transfer
   function -- the 0.04045 / 12.92 / 2.4 form, NOT a 2.2-power
   approximation), blend by the pixel's own TRUE coverage in linear
   space, then convert back (`linear_to_srgb`). This arithmetic now lives
   in `../src/icons.rs::composite_over_background` (see cause 1 above's
   own "CURRENT FIX" note for why it moved out of this file), NOT here
   any more -- this tool's own `srgb_to_linear`/`linear_to_srgb` were
   ported byte-for-byte into that Rust function and then deleted from
   this file so there is exactly one implementation, never two that could
   drift; every anti-aliased pixel a user actually sees goes through that
   ONE exact (never approximated) blend, regardless of which background
   it happens to composite against.

4. RETIRED -- "approximate the alpha for an unknown background" turned out
   not to be a real case. This tool used to ship a SECOND, `Transparent`
   sixel variant per rail/strip/gallery icon for `PtyColorMode::Inherited`
   (whose background it could not know at bake time), pre-correcting that
   variant's own ALPHA channel (`a' = 255 * (a/255)**(1/2.4)`) so a
   terminal's own naive gamma-space blend against an unknown background
   would land close to the gamma-correct result cause 3 above computes
   exactly. That whole approach solved the wrong problem: the background
   was never actually unknowable at RENDER time, only un-PAINTED --
   `render_rail_button`/`render_control_strip_button`/the icon gallery
   swatches simply left an icon-bearing button's own background to
   whatever the terminal already had there instead of stating one, the
   same gap cause 1 above now closes by removing it rather than
   approximating around it. With every icon-bearing button painting the
   SAME explicit truecolor background in every `PtyColorMode`, cause 3's
   own EXACT linear-light compositing applies universally and there is no
   more unknown-background asset left to approximate for at all --
   `SixelVariant::Transparent` (the Rust-side selector for that retired
   asset) no longer exists for the rail/strip/gallery tiers this fix
   covers, and this tool's own `precorrect_transparent_alpha` function
   went with it. The one tier this does NOT touch is `compact` (`ensure_
   compact_assets`) -- see that function's own doc comment for why it
   keeps real transparency and a real, still-necessary encoder-side
   BackgroundMode::Transparent, unrelated to this retired approximation.

5. CELL HEIGHT MISMATCH ("iconки неравномерно располагаются относительно
   подсветок" / rail icons overflow their own row) -- CONFIRMED. Every
   pixel-tier constant below was derived assuming a 10x20px terminal cell
   (`ASSUMED_CELL_WIDTH_PX`/`ASSUMED_CELL_HEIGHT_PX` -- keep these two
   numbers in sync BY HAND with the identically-named pair in
   `../icons.rs`, the same "no shared source of truth across the Python/
   Rust boundary" precedent every other pixel-size constant pair in this
   file already has). Measured against the owner's actual Windows
   Terminal / Cascadia Mono setup the real cell is 10x19, not 10x20: in a
   1129x635 window the rail's 6 columns span 60px (10.0px/col) and four
   consecutive gallery rows span 76px (19.0px/row) -- a 40px-tall rail
   icon (4 whole 10x20 cells... 2 rows at the OLD assumed 20px height)
   spans 40/19 = 2.1 real rows, i.e. it overflows its own 2-row (38px)
   cell footprint by 2px, bleeding into the row below. FIX:
   `ASSUMED_CELL_HEIGHT_PX` is now 19, and every tier's own HEIGHT
   constant is a whole multiple of it, FLOOR-rounded, never rounded up --
   undershooting a cell is safe (a blank pixel row inside the icon's own
   last cell); overshooting is not (it bleeds into whatever the next
   terminal row paints). This makes the rail tier's own pixel box
   NON-square for the first time (`SIXEL_PX_W`=40, `SIXEL_PX_H`=38, was
   40x40) -- `rasterize_sixel` below now fits a source icon within that
   non-square box by hand (`fit_within`, the same non-square-safe
   computation `rasterize_strip_sixel`/`rasterize_gallery_sixel` already
   used for their own already-non-square boxes) rather than relying on
   resvg's own `-w`/`-h` fit the way the old truly-square 40x40 box could.

6. FRACTIONAL-PIXEL STROKE LATTICE ("иконки читаются как точки, не линии"
   / icons read as dots, not lines, not a font glyph's own crisp bar) --
   CONFIRMED, exact mechanism identified. Every codicon in this manifest
   is built on a stroke lattice with EXACTLY 16 steps across its own
   viewBox: the 4 icons on a 24x24 viewBox (files/settings-gear/source-
   control/terminal) use a 1.5-unit stroke width (24/1.5 = 16 steps --
   verified against `files.svg`'s own structural path coordinates, every
   straight-segment endpoint a multiple of 1.5 except the rounded-corner
   arc control points, off-lattice by construction and meant to stay
   anti-aliased); the 52 icons on a 16x16 viewBox use a 1-unit stroke
   width (16/1 = 16 steps -- verified against `add.svg`: its plus-sign
   bar spans x=7..8 and y=7..8, both plain integers -- the SAME 16-step
   lattice at a different absolute scale, not a coincidence: codicons
   are one design system at two viewBox sizes). None of this tool's own
   per-tier target pixel sizes (`SIXEL_PX_W`x`_H` 40x38, `STRIP_SIXEL_PX_
   W`x`_H` 20x19, `GALLERY_SIXEL_PX_W`x`_H` 60x57) is a whole multiple of
   16, so the old single resvg pass fit directly to that size always
   landed the stroke lattice on a FRACTIONAL pixel -- measured on the
   actual shipped assets, alpha across a stroke: rail middle row 191,
   255, 227; strip middle row 227, 191, 191, 227 -- a smeared band, never
   a solid full-alpha core (no pixel boundary coincides with a stroke
   edge, so no pixel gets full coverage). Compare the strip/rail's own
   `─`/`│` divider glyphs elsewhere in this crate's UI: those are FONT
   glyphs, and DirectWrite grid-fits a font's stems to whole device
   pixels -- the difference the owner is seeing is grid fitting, not
   resolution. FIX: `rasterize_lattice_fit` renders the glyph at the
   LARGEST whole multiple of 16px that fits the tier's own canvas
   (`glyph_lattice_size`) -- 16px for the strip tier (1px strokes), 32px
   for the rail tier (2px strokes), 48px for the gallery tier (3px
   strokes) -- where the render scale (glyph_px / viewBox) is itself an
   exact multiple or reciprocal of 16, so every lattice-aligned stroke
   boundary maps to a whole pixel; the glyph is then padded onto the
   tier's own full canvas at an EXPLICIT, hand-computed INTEGER pixel
   offset -- never ffmpeg's own symbolic `(ow-iw)/2` expression, which
   this tool has no guarantee rounds to the SAME integer this fix's own
   correctness depends on (see `rasterize_lattice_fit`'s own doc
   comment). The one non-square source (`output.svg`, 24x25 -- cause 2
   above) cannot land both axes on the lattice at once: fitting within a
   SQUARE glyph box scales both axes by the SAME factor, dictated by
   whichever dimension is tighter (here, height), so its width axis ends
   up scaled by 16/25 rather than the lattice-exact 16/24 -- it keeps its
   own aspect ratio (never distorted to force alignment) at the cost of
   a slightly softer width-axis stroke; the one accepted, documented
   exception, same precedent as cause 2's own `output.svg` note. The
   compact tier's own canvas (10x19) cannot host a single 16px lattice
   step in its narrower dimension AT ALL (10 < 16), so `rasterize_
   compact_sixel` is UNCHANGED by this fix -- same single-pass-at-canvas-
   size treatment causes 2 and 5 already established for it; inventing a
   smaller lattice unit with no basis in the source design would be
   worse than leaving it as it already was. Curved and diagonal segments
   stay anti-aliased exactly as before -- this fix only ever changes
   scale/offset arithmetic feeding the SAME single resvg AA pass cause 2
   already established, never resvg's own anti-aliasing, and a curve
   cannot sit on an axis-aligned pixel lattice by definition. Gamma-
   correct compositing (cause 3) runs AFTER this, completely unchanged, on
   whatever buffer this produces -- this fix only changes WHERE the ink
   pixels land, never how they get colored.

7. STRIP-TIER GLYPH CLUTTER (owner: the 2x1 control-plane buttons read as
   having "какие-то полосы или линии... там просто что-то кроме
   необходимого" -- something beyond the necessary shape) -- CONFIRMED for
   `new-file`/`new-folder`. Both source SVGs carry codicons' own filled
   circle-with-plus "add" badge overlapping the file/folder body outline
   (verified against the cached source: the badge is a second, separately
   readable shape, not a decorative stroke inside one shape) -- at the
   strip tier's own 16px lattice-fit render (cause 6 above) the badge
   covers roughly a third of the glyph and collides with the body outline,
   reading as clutter rather than a single recognizable icon; this is the
   icon's own design, not a rasterization defect, so no pixel-pipeline fix
   applies. FIX: `IconSpec.strip_slug` lets a spec's STRIP-tier bake pull
   from a DIFFERENT source codicon than its rail/compact/gallery tiers --
   `NewFile`/`NewFolder` point their own strip bake at `file`/`folder`
   (the plain, badge-free glyphs this manifest already ships for
   `IconId::File`/`IconId::Folder`), while every other tier keeps the
   badge version, which reads fine at the rail/compact/gallery tiers'
   own larger sizes -- see `render::render_compact_icon_button`'s own doc
   comment for why the compact tier is large enough to keep the badge.
   This changes ONLY the strip-tier PIXELS for these two icons, never the
   Rust-side `IconId::NewFile`/`NewFolder` identity, their ascii labels,
   or what their buttons do. Every other icon actually used at the strip
   tier (`Add`, `Trash`, `Refresh`, `RepoForked`, `GoToFile` -- see
   `render.rs`'s own `ControlStripButton` call sites) was checked against
   the same "a glyph whose detail cannot survive 16px" question: `add`/
   `trash`/`refresh` are each a single coherent shape at the codicon
   set's own native 16px design size and read fine; `repo-forked`'s three
   small fork-node circles and `go-to-file`'s own compound file+arrow
   glyph are busier by design and worth the owner's own judgment call, but
   neither carries a SEPARATE overlapping badge the way `new-file`/`new-
   folder` did, so neither is substituted here -- flagged, not silently
   changed.

Also: every sixel encode (all tiers, all variants) goes through
`icons.rs::icon_encode_options()` -- `max_colors: 32` (the library's own
default is 256) and `diffusion: 0.0` (the library's own default is
Floyd-Steinberg dithering) -- "encode with a small explicit palette" per
this task's own original brief. A composited icon's true colour count is
just its own number of distinct alpha/coverage levels (measured on real
baked assets at authoring time: 6-26 across this manifest), so 32 is
generous headroom, not a visible compression; dithering exists to fake
extra apparent colours via spatial noise for photographic content and
only ever adds speckle noise to a flat-colour UI glyph like these, so it
is switched off outright rather than tuned down.
