//! The Pet Bastion arcade overlay: host-side glue between `gate4agent-tui`
//! and the `hatchery-arcade` mini-game engine. Owns exactly one hosted
//! run (paused, in progress, or finished) and every piece of state its
//! glyph-tier board needs to be driven from either input device -- a
//! selected-tile/selected-anchor cursor (keyboard: `Tab`/`[`/`]`, still the
//! only way to MOVE the cursor without touching a tile directly) plus a
//! selected tower kind and an inspected-entity slot (mouse: `click_tile`/
//! `click_tower_kind`/`inspect_wave`, driven straight off the board's own
//! on-screen tile grid -- see `render::render_pet_arcade`'s own doc
//! comment for how a screen cell resolves to a board tile).
//!
//! # Free build placement, not fixed pads, not a route-proximity radius
//!
//! `hatchery-arcade-pet-bastion`'s own board (`board.rs`) used to expose
//! ten fixed build pads (`PadId`/`PADS`), then a build radius around each
//! route. Both are gone -- it now exposes every board cell that is not
//! itself a route/choke tile, a pet anchor, or already occupied
//! (`Board::build_zone_cells`, surfaced per-run as `SimulationSnapshot::
//! build_cells`; owner's own ask, "я хочу ставить куда хочу"), and
//! `Command::Place` addresses a `Tile` directly. This module tracks a
//! `selected_tile: Tile` cursor rather than a pad index, and every "which
//! cell can I build on right now" query (`Tab`/`BackTab` cycling, a tower
//! drag's own board highlight -- [`build_drag_state_at`]) reads
//! `SimulationSnapshot::build_cells` -- never a hand-maintained pad table
//! -- so this module never needs a second update the next time that
//! list's own eligibility rules change.
//!
//! Drawing lives in `render.rs` (`render_pet_arcade`), matching this
//! crate's own "every `render_*` fn lives in `render.rs`" convention --
//! this module owns simulation/session state and input handling only, the
//! same split `hatchery-arcade-pet-bastion` (rules) vs. `gate4agent-
//! arcade-pet-bastion-render` (presentation) already draws one layer down.
//!
//! # Why `Rc<RefCell<PetArcade>>`, not a plain field
//!
//! `App` derives `Clone, Debug` (exercised by real, non-`cfg(test)`-gated
//! test code that clones a live `App` to render it twice under a mutated
//! field). Neither `hatchery_arcade_engine::Runner` nor `GameScreen` nor
//! `ArcadeShell` implement `Clone` -- `Runner`'s own fields are private
//! with no public reconstruction API, so there is no way to hand-clone one
//! from outside the engine crate at all. `Rc::clone` sidesteps this
//! entirely (a refcount bump requires nothing of the pointee), so `App`'s
//! own derive is satisfied by a manual, non-inspecting [`std::fmt::Debug`]
//! impl on [`PetArcade`] below plus `Rc`'s unconditional `Clone` -- at the
//! cost of `App::clone()` sharing the SAME underlying session with its
//! clone rather than deep-copying it, which every existing caller of that
//! derive (icon-gallery/settings render-twice tests, unrelated to the
//! arcade) never observes.
//!
//! # Admission
//!
//! The engine's own `AdmissionSource` is a host-decided trust boundary the
//! engine never inspects (see `hatchery_arcade_engine::admission`'s own
//! doc comment) -- it converts whatever real consumption signal a host
//! trusts into a plain credit count before `Runner::start` ever runs. This
//! TUI has no energy/session economy wired to the arcade yet, so
//! [`UnlimitedAdmission`] grants every run unconditionally; wiring a real
//! economy in later only ever replaces that one `AdmissionSource` impl,
//! never any call site below.
