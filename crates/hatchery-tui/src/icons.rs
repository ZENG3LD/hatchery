//! Baked codicon bitmaps for this crate's icon catalog -- the full
//! ~57-icon set (see [`IconId`]), not just the activity rail's original
//! 7. Offline-rasterized, raw RGBA8 bytes checked straight into the
//! crate via `include_bytes!` -- no `usvg`/`resvg`/`uzor-icon` runtime or
//! build dependency. Every icon is baked in ONE raster tier (see
//! `render::render_rail_button` / `app::RailIcons`), switched globally
//! by the owner's own preference, not fixed per button, plus a plain
//! ASCII text tier:
//!
//! - Sixel (`RailIcons::Sixel`): a real raster image written directly to
//!   the terminal by `client::run`'s post-flush hook -- see [`sixel`].
//! - Ascii (`RailIcons::Ascii`): a short (<=2 char) plain-text label --
//!   see [`ascii`]. The activity rail itself still paints its OWN
//!   `render::RailButton::ascii` literal in this mode rather than
//!   calling [`ascii`] (see "Wiring status" below); that field's values
//!   match what [`ascii`] returns for the same 7 icons regardless.
//!
//! A third tier, Braille (a `uzor_tui::canvas::PixelCanvas` painted
//! straight into the cell buffer), shipped earlier and was removed
//! outright on the owner's own order: braille's fixed 2x4 dots/cell
//! density means the strip tier's own 2x1-cell button footprint is just
//! a 4x4 dot grid -- nothing left to improve, unusably low quality. Same
//! fate as the still-earlier half-block tier (see `app::RailIcons`'s own
//! doc comment).
//!
//! ## Wiring status
//!
//! The activity rail itself wires only `Files`, `SourceControl`,
//! `Person`, `Project`, `SettingsGear`, and `Layout` (its own icon-gallery
//! button), via `render::render_activity_rail`'s own `RailButton::icon:
//! icons::IconId` field -- re-pointed at the wider [`IconId`] enum so
//! there is exactly one icon source in this crate (there used to be a
//! rail-only `RailIconId`; it no longer exists). `ChevronLeft`/
//! `ChevronRight` are NOT part of that set: the rail has no separate
//! collapse button any more (see `render_activity_rail`'s own "There is
//! no separate collapse button here any more" doc comment), so those two
//! variants are currently unused. Beyond the rail, the strip tier
//! (`render::render_control_strip_button`) and the compact tier
//! (`render::render_compact_icon_button`) wire a growing set of their
//! own -- `NewFile`/`NewFolder`/`Add`/`Trash`/`Refresh`/`RepoForked` on
//! the Explorer/Git/Agents control strips, `Search`/`ArrowUp`/`Check`/
//! `Close`/`GoToFile`/and others across the sidebar panels and modals --
//! see each call site rather than this doc keeping its own duplicate
//! tally, since that list grows independently of the rail's own. Every
//! [`IconId`] variant is baked and unit-tested (see this module's own
//! `tests`) regardless of whether a UI site draws it yet.
//!
//! ## Source, licence, regeneration
//!
//! Source: microsoft/vscode-codicons (MIT licence,
//! <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons>). Every icon's
//! `fill="currentColor"` is patched to `#cdd6f4` -- this crate's own
//! `pty_palette::GATE_FG` (the off-white already used for unselected rail
//! glyph/ascii labels) -- before rasterizing, so every tier reads as part
//! of the existing theme instead of an arbitrary new color. `resvg`
//! writes straight (non-premultiplied) alpha -- verified against this
//! exact resvg build by inspecting a partially-transparent output
//! pixel's own RGB channels, which stayed at the flat fill color
//! regardless of alpha -- so every "ink" source pixel below can be read
//! as (a flat icon color, a coverage/antialiasing weight) without an
//! un-premultiply step.
//!
//! Every `.rgba` asset under `src/icons/` and the generated
//! `src/icons/catalog.rs` module (see [`catalog`]) are produced by
//! `tools/bake_icons.py` (Python 3 + `resvg` 0.47 CLI + `ffmpeg` --
//! neither a dependency of this crate; both run once, offline). Re-run:
//!
//! ```text
//! python tools/bake_icons.py --force
//! ```
//!
//! That tool's own header doc comment has the full pipeline (the exact
//! `resvg`/`ffmpeg` filter graphs, byte-for-byte); this module doc does
//! not reproduce it, to avoid the two drifting apart. Every icon --
//! including the activity rail's original 7 -- is baked through this
//! SAME single pipeline; there is no separate frozen-legacy-asset path
//! (there used to be one, replaying the original 7's own hand-picked
//! braille alpha thresholds unchanged; it was retired along with the
//! braille tier itself).
//!
//! ## Sixel background variants ([`SixelVariant`])
//!
//! `icy_sixel`'s own encoder applies a hard alpha>=128 opacity threshold
//! per pixel with NO blend information in the encoded stream at all --
//! every surviving pixel carries only its flat, un-blended ink colour, so
//! anti-aliasing cannot survive this encoder in alpha, only in RGB (see
//! `tools/bake_icons.py`'s own header doc comment, cause 1, for the full
//! diagnosis). The fix is to composite every rail/strip/gallery sixel-tier
//! icon over the EXACT background colour its button actually shows there,
//! fully opaque, so there is no transparent pixel left for the encoder's
//! threshold to drop and the anti-aliasing this buys back rides in RGB
//! instead, where that threshold cannot touch it.
//!
//! FIRST ITERATION (retired) painted an EXPLICIT truecolor background
//! (`SIDEBAR_BG`/`ACTIVE_BG`) unconditionally across the rail column, the
//! control-plane strip row, and the icon gallery's own swatch band, in
//! EVERY `PtyColorMode` -- including `PtyColorMode::Inherited`, where the
//! terminal's own real background had never actually been stated before.
//! That traded the original dirty-edge defect for a NEW one: on the
//! owner's own terminal the real background measured (12,12,12), nowhere
//! close to `ACTIVE_BG`'s (30,30,46), so the rail read as a visibly
//! LIGHTER "plate" standing out against the actually-darker surface
//! around it -- correct compositing arithmetic against the WRONG colour.
//!
//! CURRENT FIX: [`crate::terminal_bg`] queries the terminal's own real
//! background once at startup (OSC 11, before `client::run` ever touches
//! raw mode or the alternate screen -- see that module's own doc comment
//! for the full exchange and why it must run that early), and the rail
//! column/strip row/gallery band go back to INHERITING their surrounding
//! panel's own background (`theme.panel`/`theme.surface`) instead of
//! stating one -- see `render::render_activity_rail`/`render_control_
//! strip`/`render_icon_gallery`'s own doc comments. A sixel icon still
//! needs a concrete, known RGB to composite against (real transparency
//! is not achievable through this encoder at all -- the whole reason this
//! section exists), so [`composite_over_background`] now runs at RENDER
//! time, in Rust, against whichever concrete background a given
//! placement's [`SixelVariant`] actually resolves to right now
//! (`resolve_variant_background`) -- the queried/fallback terminal colour
//! for an un-selected button in `PtyColorMode::Inherited` (matching
//! `theme.active`'s own `Color::Reset`), `PtyColorMode::GateOverride`'s
//! own fixed, deliberate theme colour for that same un-selected case
//! (matching `theme.active`'s own stated `ACTIVE_BG` there), or the fixed
//! selected-state accent (`MAUVE`) wherever a button genuinely IS
//! selected, in either mode -- never a bake-time constant. Every icon's
//! encode is cached (keyed by icon, tier, family, and the resolved
//! background RGB, [`cached_composited_sixel`]) so this still only costs
//! real work once per distinct combination actually seen, not once per
//! frame -- see that function's own doc comment.
//!
//! An UN-SELECTED button reading as visually flat with its own column is
//! the point, not a regression: only a SELECTED rail button is a real,
//! deliberate state the owner should be able to see at a glance, so only
//! that state states a colour of its own ([`SixelVariant::GateAccent`]);
//! an at-rest button asking for anything OTHER than what its own column
//! already shows is the exact same plate defect one level down. The
//! control-plane strip (no selected state at all) and the icon gallery (a
//! read-only comparison grid, also no selected state) follow the SAME
//! rule for the SAME reason -- every placement they push is
//! [`SixelVariant::GateActive`], resolved the identical way.
//!
//! The compact tier stays out of scope (see `render::render_compact_icon_
//! button`'s own doc comment) and keeps real transparency, encoded with
//! `BackgroundMode::Transparent`, since it has no single known background
//! to paint at all -- unaffected by any of this, unchanged since before
//! cause 1's own first iteration. The ascii tier needs no equivalent of
//! any of this either: it is plain themed text drawn directly with the
//! button's own background style, not a raster image.
//!
//! ## Lucide (a second family, alongside codicons -- [`IconFamily`])
//!
//! Everything above describes codicons, which stay exactly as they are
//! and stay the default (`IconFamily::Codicons`, see that type's own doc
//! comment in `app.rs`). Lucide (<https://lucide.dev>,
//! <https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide>) is baked ALONGSIDE it, at
//! the owner's own request, specifically because it is a STROKE-based
//! family: every glyph is an unfilled outline (`fill="none"`) whose ink
//! lives entirely in one `stroke-width` attribute, unlike codicons' filled
//! outlines (stroke weight baked into each path's own geometry, no
//! separate width knob at all) -- so Lucide is the one family this crate
//! can actually offer a thickness comparison against.
//!
//! Licence: read directly from lucide-icons/lucide's own `LICENSE` file at
//! authoring time (do not assume): ISC (Copyright (c) 2026 Lucide Icons
//! and Contributors) for the set as a whole, PLUS MIT (Copyright (c)
//! 2013-present Cole Bemis) for a named subset derived from the Feather
//! project -- both permissive, both permit shipping a derived raster
//! under this crate's own licence, same as codicons' MIT terms above; see
//! `tools/bake_icons.py`'s own header doc comment for the full text and
//! `src/icons/catalog.rs`'s own generated header for the same attribution
//! restated next to the code it covers.
//!
//! Mapping: every [`IconId`] maps to AT MOST one Lucide slug
//! (`tools/bake_icons.py::LUCIDE_SLUGS`, 55 of 57) -- [`lucide_slug`]
//! exposes that mapping at runtime. The two icons with no Lucide glyph
//! that carries the SAME MEANING (`CircleFilled` -- Lucide ships no
//! solid-fill glyph at all, a style gap, not a naming one; `RunAll` -- no
//! Lucide glyph distinctly means "run everything" rather than colliding
//! with `Play`'s own meaning) are a REPORTED gap
//! (`tools/bake_icons.py::LUCIDE_GAPS`), never an approximate
//! substitution -- [`sixel_family`]/[`sixel_strip_family`]/
//! [`sixel_gallery_family`]/[`sixel_compact_family`] (called with
//! `family: IconFamily::Lucide`) return `None` for them rather than
//! silently resolving to something the wrong shape implies.
//! `render::render_gallery_size_swatch` is the one call site
//! that can actually observe a `None` today (the icon gallery includes
//! both gap icons specifically so the gap itself is visible, not just
//! documented) -- it paints a plain `n/a` label instead of a placement.
//!
//! Stroke lattice: Lucide's viewBox is a fixed 24 units (vs codicons' own
//! 16- or 24-unit grid, see this module's own cause-6 doc section above),
//! and every tier already renders its glyph at a WHOLE multiple of 16px
//! before padding onto the tier's own canvas (`tools/bake_icons.py::
//! glyph_lattice_size`/`rasterize_lattice_fit`, reused UNCHANGED for
//! Lucide -- only the fetch/patch step differs, see `tools/
//! bake_icons.py`'s own header). [`LUCIDE_STROKE_WIDTH`] (1.5, in Lucide's
//! own 24-unit source space) is chosen so that render lands on a whole
//! device pixel at all three glyph sizes at once: 16px (strip) -> 1.5 *
//! 16/24 = 1px; 32px (rail) -> 1.5 * 32/24 = 2px; 48px (gallery) -> 1.5 *
//! 48/24 = 3px -- ONE authored width, three whole-pixel strokes, verified
//! on the actual baked bytes by this module's own `lucide_stroke_lands_
//! on_whole_pixels_at_every_tier` test below, not just asserted by the
//! arithmetic. `app::LucideStrokeWidth` is the owner-facing Settings
//! knob this constant feeds -- see that type's own doc comment for why
//! only this ONE value is offered today.
