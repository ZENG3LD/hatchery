//! Loopback control endpoint for driving and inspecting a running
//! `gate4agent-tui`/`gate4agent-tui-light` process programmatically --
//! built so an agent verifying the app never again has to grab the
//! operator's real mouse and keyboard the way it did before this module
//! existed (see this crate's own delivery notes for that incident).
//!
//! **Off by default.** `client::RunOptions::control_plane` is `None`
//! unless `gate4agent-tui`'s own `--control-plane LOOPBACK_SOCKET` flag is
//! given; `client::run` then never calls [`spawn`], so the default build
//! binds no socket and spawns no thread -- byte-identical to before this
//! module existed. The credential comes from the environment
//! (`GATE4AGENT_TUI_CONTROL_TOKEN`, see `main.rs`), never argv, matching
//! `GATE4AGENT_HARNESS_OPERATOR_TOKEN`'s own precedent.
//!
//! **Loopback only.** [`spawn`] checks `SocketAddr::ip().is_loopback()`
//! itself, BEFORE ever calling `TcpListener::bind` -- the same precedent
//! `HarnessOperatorClient::new` already sets for the harness operator wire
//! (`gate4agent-harness-client`), just enforced on the bind side instead
//! of the connect side.
//!
//! **Wire idiom.** One newline-terminated JSON [`ControlEnvelopeV1`] per
//! TCP connection (`{"build_stamp", "credential", "request"}`), the caller
//! then half-closes its write side (EOF is the request boundary, exactly
//! `gate4agent-harness-api`'s own `HarnessOperatorEnvelopeV1` framing --
//! see [`read_request`]), and exactly one newline-terminated
//! [`ControlReplyV1`] (`{"status": "ok"|"error", ...}`) comes back before
//! the connection closes. No second serialization style invented for this
//! crate.
//!
//! **Credential.** [`ControlPlaneCredential`] mirrors
//! `HarnessOperatorCredential`'s own shape: a fixed `g4atc_` prefix plus 64
//! lowercase-hex bytes. The configured secret is compared against a
//! presented one via an HMAC-SHA256 digest and a constant-time comparison
//! (`hatchery_node_wire::{local_hmac_sha256, proofs_match}`), the same
//! primitives `gate4agent-harness-service`'s own
//! `HarnessOperatorCredentialAuthority` uses -- not a second, hand-rolled
//! comparison scheme.
//!
//! **Single writer.** [`apply`] is the ONLY function in this module that
//! ever touches `&mut App`, and it is only ever called from `client::
//! run`'s own event loop, on that loop's own thread -- the same discipline
//! `apply_update`/`WorkerUpdate` already hold for every other worker
//! thread in this crate. A `ControlCommand` crossing from a TCP connection
//! thread into that loop (via a `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel, `blocking_
//! send` from the connection thread exactly like `harness_operator_worker`
//! already does) is the same shape as every other worker-to-loop hand-off
//! in `client.rs`; the connection thread then blocks on a
//! `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel` reply for up to [`CONTROL_REPLY_DEADLINE`]
//! before answering the caller.
//!
//! **Same input path as real input.** `InjectKey`/`InjectMouse` decode
//! into exactly the types real terminal input decodes into
//! (`crate::app::UiKey` / `crossterm::event::MouseEvent`) and [`apply`]
//! dispatches them through `App::reduce`/`client::map_mouse` -- the exact
//! same functions `client::run`'s own crossterm event arms call. There is
//! no separate "synthetic input" reducer to drift out of sync with the
//! real one.
//!
//! **`InjectKey` cannot drive a PTY on its own -- and says nothing when it
//! doesn't.** A keystroke only ever reaches a session's PTY by riding
//! `App::reduce`'s focus/overlay dispatch chain down into `App::
//! reduce_viewport`, which then builds a bare `AppAction::Input`/
//! `TerminalBytes`; THAT still has to survive `App::route_harness_session_
//! verb`'s rewrite into `AppAction::HarnessWriteSessionInput`/
//! `HarnessWriteSessionBytes` before `client::send_operator_action` ever
//! calls `HarnessOperatorClient::write_session_input` -- and that rewrite
//! silently degrades to `AppAction::None` (`App::harness_session_address`'s
//! own `?`) the moment the target node's harness incarnation isn't known
//! yet. `apply`'s own `ControlResponseV1::Injected` reply only ever means
//! "the reducer saw this key", per its own doc comment below -- it says
//! nothing about whether any of THAT downstream chain actually ran, so an
//! `InjectKey` aimed at a real PTY pane can come back `status: ok` having
//! written zero bytes anywhere, with no record of why. [`write_pty`] exists
//! because of exactly that: it addresses a session directly (bypassing
//! focus/overlay dispatch entirely -- there is nothing there worth
//! re-testing for a PTY write), runs the same running-session guard `App::
//! reduce_viewport` runs, and runs the SAME `route_harness_session_verb`
//! rewrite real input runs -- but when that rewrite degrades to `None`,
//! [`write_pty`] returns `ControlErrorV1::NodeIncarnationUnknown` instead
//! of a silent `ok`.
