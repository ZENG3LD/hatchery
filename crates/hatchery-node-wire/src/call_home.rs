//! The call-home preface: one frame, sent by a node that dials the relay
//! instead of waiting to be dialled.
//!
//! Everything else on this wire is opened by the operator, so the operator
//! always knows whose socket it holds. A node with no reachable address
//! cannot be dialled at all, so it connects out -- and then the relay is
//! holding an accepted socket with no idea which node is on the far end,
//! and no way to guess, because verifying the node's own proof requires
//! that node's access token.
//!
//! So the node names itself first, and the handshake that follows is
//! byte-for-byte the one a dialled connection runs. See
//! [`NodeCallHomeAnnounce`]'s own doc comment for why naming yourself is
//! not authentication and grants nothing.
