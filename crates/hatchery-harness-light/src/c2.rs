//! Shared C2 call helpers: route resolution against the live topology and a
//! bounded node snapshot fetch, used by both `crate::inventory` (roster
//! maintenance) and `crate::relay` (spawn profile preflight). Mirrors
//! `gate4agent-harness-service::c2::HarnessC2Adapter::exact_route`/
//! `snapshot` (both `pub`, but `HarnessC2Adapter` keeps its `control:
//! C2ReconnectingHandle` field private and exposes no generic request path
//! by design -- see that type's own doc comment -- so reusing it here would
//! still leave this crate needing its own raw `C2ReconnectingHandle` for the
//! session-verb relay, and opening a second, separate C2 connection
//! alongside it would hold two authenticated operator sessions against the
//! same C2 for no reason). This crate instead owns one `C2ReconnectingHandle`
//! directly (`gate4agent-c2-client`, the same primitive
//! `HarnessC2Adapter::connect` itself wraps) and reimplements these two
//! small, pure read-path helpers against it.
