//! In-process operator credential minting and verification.
//!
//! `hatchery-harness-service`'s own operator credential check
//! (`HarnessOperatorCredentialAuthority` in `runtime.rs`) is a private,
//! non-`pub` type, and is bound to an *externally supplied* credential (the
//! full harness reads `GATE4AGENT_HARNESS_OPERATOR_TOKEN` from the
//! environment -- see `hatchery-harness-service/src/bin/gate4agent-
//! harness.rs`). Light mode's contract is the opposite: the credential is
//! generated fresh in-process at `start_harness_light` and handed back to
//! the caller, never read from the environment. This module is therefore a
//! deliberate, small light-local reimplementation, not a promotion --
//! rehosting the private type would not have fit `start_harness_light`'s
//! signature anyway. It mirrors that type's own technique exactly (reduce
//! the credential to an HMAC digest, compare digests in constant time via
//! `proofs_match`), just generated rather than externally supplied.
