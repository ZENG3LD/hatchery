//! Maintains the light harness's runtime inventory (nodes, workspaces,
//! sessions, launch inventory) from live C2 snapshots and events, and serves
//! `RuntimeInventoryList`.
//!
//! Unlike `hatchery-harness-service::runtime::HarnessRuntimeInventoryCache`
//! (`pub(crate)`, keyed to `HarnessObservationResync` -- the full harness's
//! own gap-tracked, event-sequence-recovering resync object built by its
//! observation bridge/adapter), this cache always rebuilds a node's whole
//! entry from a fresh `NodeRequest::Snapshot` rather than applying
//! incremental deltas. That is a deliberate light-local simplification, not
//! an oversight: `HarnessObservationResync` is entangled with the kernel's
//! own observation-recovery machinery (`ObservationSupportRegistry`,
//! `RouteObservationRecovery`, gap detection) that light mode has no
//! equivalent for and does not want (light is stateless -- no SQLite
//! observation store). A full re-snapshot per relevant event is simpler,
//! trivially correct (it can never drift from whatever C2/the node
//! currently reports), and cheap enough at light mode's expected traffic.
//!
//! The projection from a raw `SlimNodeInventory` to the wire's
//! `HarnessRuntimeInventoryV1` (workspace/session/managed-session/launch-
//! inventory field mapping) is NOT reimplemented here: it is pure,
//! kernel-independent data mapping, so it is reused verbatim via
//! `hatchery_harness_service::runtime::redact_runtime_inventory` (promoted
//! `pub` for this crate -- see that function's doc comment).
