# hatchery — agent control plane, harness and TUI

hatchery is the agent control plane's HQ: Harness (task kernel, SQLite SWC) +
observation + TUI. It is built on `gate4agent` -- everything about providers:
the library that spawns, streams, and resumes CLI coding-agent subprocesses
over PTY/pipe/ACP/daemon transports, the node process (PTY/processes/
workspaces/worktrees) and the C2 relay that reaches nodes on remote machines
-- as a sibling repository at `..\gate4agent`, linked by path, not vendored.
hatchery talks to the node and the C2 only through `gate4agent-node-protocol`
and `gate4agent-c2-protocol`/`-c2-client`; outside tests it never links the
node or C2 server crates. The observation vocabulary is hatchery's: the node
publishes control events and the agent stream, and
`hatchery_observation_engine::node_projection` derives `ObservationV1` from
them (a C2 client that negotiated `control-detail-v1` receives the sanitized
control detail that projection needs). Agent mail is `mail4agent` (`:18301`), its own service: the
harness holds no mailbox, and the TUI does not read mail4agent yet. Both
clients speak ONLY the harness operator wire: `hatchery-tui` against a
durable harness, and `hatchery-tui-light` against
`hatchery-harness-light`, which it hosts in-process over c2 with no task
kernel behind it. Neither app speaks c2 itself. TUI binary names are
`hatchery-tui` / `hatchery-tui-light`. Pipe names, `GATE4AGENT_*` env vars,
and the `g4aho_` credential prefix are still inherited from `gate4agent`
— a later step renames those remaining runtime identifiers. Plans/handoffs/audits live in the owner's
private workspace documentation tree, not in this repository.

## Local endpoints & credentials

- node pipe `\\.\pipe\gate4agent-node`, api `:18310`; primary c2 pipe
  `\\.\pipe\gate4agent-c2`, api `:18320`; harness operator read `:18330`.
- The harness does NOT share the primary c2. It connects through a SECOND
  c2 instance of its own on pipe `\\.\pipe\gate4agent-c2-harness`, api
  `:18321`, so a live stack is four processes: node, two c2, harness.
  Bringing one up without that second instance fails at the harness with
  "`--c2-endpoint` connect failed ... (os error 2)".
- A c2 instance needs the per-node secret, not just `GATE4AGENT_C2_TOKEN`:
  without `GATE4AGENT_NODE_TOKEN_<NORMALIZED_ID>` it refuses to start.
  The normalized id is the `--node-id` uppercased with every non-alnum
  character replaced by `_`.
- Operator credential: `g4aho_` + 64 hex, env
  `GATE4AGENT_HARNESS_OPERATOR_TOKEN`. Node/c2 secrets:
  `GATE4AGENT_NODE_TOKEN`, `GATE4AGENT_NODE_TOKEN_<NORMALIZED_ID>`
  (uppercase, non-alnum→`_`), `GATE4AGENT_C2_TOKEN`. Env-only, never argv.
- Windows E2Es run only via
  `..\gate4agent\target\release\windows-headless-supervisor.exe <ms> <ABS exe> --exact <fn>`
  — that binary belongs to `gate4agent-testkit`, which stays in `gate4agent`,
  not here.
- `crates\hatchery-tui` is its own cargo workspace and depends on
  `uzor-tui` from crates.io — every TUI build compiles the uzor
  dependency tree, so it is a slow build from cold and a large target. The
  status bar's pet overlay links in-tree `crates\hatchery-arcade` (NOT a
  gate4agent sibling; arcade is hatchery-owned). Sources for arcade are
  currently missing — see `crates\hatchery-arcade\README.md`.

## Running the live stack and the TUI

Bring the four processes up in order — node, both c2, harness — then the
TUI. Secrets live in the `gate4agent` repo, at
`..\gate4agent\.run\p0-live-20260818\relaunch.env`, and are loaded into the
environment; never pass them in argv. That relaunch env has not moved into
`hatchery` — it stays there until the runtime-identifier rename.

```powershell
$H    = "C:\Users\VA PC\CODING\ML_TRADING\nemo\hatchery"
$G    = "C:\Users\VA PC\CODING\ML_TRADING\nemo\gate4agent"
$R    = Join-Path $G ".run\p0-live-20260818"
$bin  = Join-Path $H "target\release"
Get-Content (Join-Path $R "relaunch.env") | ForEach-Object {
  if ($_ -match '^([A-Z0-9_]+)=(.*)$') { Set-Item -Path ("env:" + $matches[1]) -Value $matches[2] } }
$env:GATE4AGENT_NODE_TOKEN_OPBOX_WINDOWS_X86_64_1D67E837F8FA = $env:GATE4AGENT_NODE_TOKEN
```

`Start-Process -ArgumentList` must get ONE quoted string, not an array.
An array is joined with spaces and nothing is re-quoted, so every path
holding a space is split — node reports `workspace 'gate4agent' root
'C:\Users\VA' is invalid: path is not a directory` and exits.

**node, both c2, and the harness are spawned headless** — pass
`-WindowStyle Hidden` and redirect both streams to a log in `$R`. They are
background services with nothing to show; a console window per process
clutters the desktop the operator is actually working in, and their output
belongs in a file you can read afterwards anyway. The TUI is the only one
of the five that gets a window, and it gets it from `wt`.

- node — `--node-id opbox-windows-x86-64-1d67e837f8fa`, one
  `--workspace "<name>=<abs path>"` per repo, a matching
  `--worktree-mode <name>=manual`, one
  `--history-root "<provider>|<layout>|<abs root>"` per provider, then
  `--endpoint \.\pipe\gate4agent-node --api-listen 127.0.0.1:18310`.
- c2 (primary) — `--node opbox-windows-x86-64-1d67e837f8fa=\.\pipe\gate4agent-node
  --api-listen 127.0.0.1:18320 --control-endpoint \.\pipe\gate4agent-c2`.
- c2 (harness's own) — the same line with `:18321` and
  `\.\pipe\gate4agent-c2-harness`.
- harness — `--harness-db "$R\harness.sqlite3" --observation-db
  "$R\observation.sqlite3" --c2-endpoint \.\pipe\gate4agent-c2-harness
  --read-bind 127.0.0.1:18330`.

Up means all four ports listening and node `/health` returning 200. c2's
`/status` wants a credential, so a bare request coming back non-2xx is not
by itself a failure — read `<name>.err.log` in `$R` before deciding.

Build the TUI from INSIDE its own workspace. `cargo build -p hatchery-tui`
at the repo root fails with `did not match any packages`, because
`crates\hatchery-tui\Cargo.toml` declares its own `[workspace]`:

```powershell
cd (Join-Path $H "crates\hatchery-tui")
cargo build --release --bin hatchery-tui --bin hatchery-tui-light
```

Launch it in Windows Terminal exactly like this, exe path quoted:

```powershell
$tui = Join-Path $H "crates\hatchery-tui\target\release\hatchery-tui.exe"
$q   = '"'
Start-Process "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe" `
  -ArgumentList "-w new --title G4A $q$tui$q --harness-operator 127.0.0.1:18330 --style gate"
```

### A monochrome TUI is `--style inherit`, not a broken renderer

`--style` picks the palette, and `inherit` means "paint with whatever
palette the host terminal has". On a terminal left at its stock palette
that resolves to one foreground on one background for the ENTIRE app —
borders, tabs, status fields, icons and PTY cells alike. It looks exactly
like an app that lost its colours, and it is stored in `tui.conf`
(`style=inherit`), so it survives restarts and follows you into every new
window until something rewrites it.

`gate` is the app's own palette and is now the default. Launch with
`--style gate`, or press Ctrl+T to cycle, if a session ever comes up
colourless. Before hunting a colour bug anywhere else in the stack, read
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Gate4Agent\tui.conf` and check that line — a whole
investigation into `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, `NO_COLOR`, the node's PTY
environment and the vt100 bridge ended at that one setting.

Separately, and genuinely: the node passes its own environment to every
PTY child, so a `NO_COLOR=1` in whatever shell launched the node reaches
the provider CLI and turns its output monochrome for real. Agent harnesses
commonly set it. Clear it before starting the node.

**Do not add flags to that line.** `--size` and `--pos` are window options
accepted only BEFORE `-w`; placed after it, `wt` reads the tail as the
command to run, opens a window titled `Error` and starts nothing. They are
not options of `new-tab` at all. Want a bigger window — resize it by hand.

`wt` exits 0 whether or not it started anything, and `MainWindowTitle` is a
property of the PROCESS while a single `WindowsTerminal` process hosts every
window — so an unrelated window's title gets read back and believed. Verify
a launch by the thing you launched: `Get-Process hatchery-tui`.

### Screenshotting and driving the window

**Capture with `PrintWindow(hwnd, dc, PW_RENDERFULLCONTENT /* 2 */)`, never
`CopyFromScreen`.** `PrintWindow` asks the window to render itself, so it
works while the window is behind others or partly off-screen, and it never
steals focus from the operator. `CopyFromScreen` reads the desktop at the
window's rect and returns whatever is on top of it — that is how a capture
comes back showing an unrelated application and gets believed.

Driving it with synthetic input needs two details, and it silently does
nothing without either:

- **Keys need a scan code.** `keybd_event(vk, 0, ...)` is ignored by
  Windows Terminal; pass `MapVirtualKey(vk, 0)` as the scan byte.
- **Clicks need `MOUSEEVENTF_VIRTUALDESK`.** With
  `MOVE|ABSOLUTE` (`0x8001`) alone the normalized coordinates are read
  against the PRIMARY monitor, so every click lands on the wrong screen the
  moment the window is on a second one. Use `0xC001` and normalize against
  `SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN`/`SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN`.

Screen coordinates for a click come from `GetWindowRect` plus the offset
measured in the `PrintWindow` bitmap — the bitmap is that rect, so the two
line up directly.

## Build output

**One target directory per workspace: the root `target/` and the TUI's
own `crates\hatchery-tui\target\`. Never a directory per task, agent or
scenario.** Each such directory is a FULL copy of the dependency build —
seven of them had accumulated to 52 GB, and the machine was failing
builds outright (`rustc` exiting `STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`, the shell
reporting the paging file too small) until they were cleaned.

The practice they came from was documented here as avoiding Cargo's build
lock on parallel runs. That trade is not worth taking: the lock makes a
second build WAIT, which is the point of it — it never corrupts anything
and never loses work. Waiting is cheap; tens of gigabytes and a compiler
that cannot allocate are not.

`.gitignore` matches `target*/` rather than `target/` as a safety net for
directories that already exist, not as permission to create more.
